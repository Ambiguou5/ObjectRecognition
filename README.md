# ObjectRecognition
Uses the iOS device camera and a custom deep learning algorithm to perform real time object recognition.

I designed & trained a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-100 database of object images for 100 different classes of objects (such as trains, aircraft, different types of flowers).

The neural network is run uses iOS' new CoreML to efficiently run in real time.
